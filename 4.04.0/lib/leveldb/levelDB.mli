(** Access to [leveldb] databases. *)

(** {2 Usage in a concurrent setting}
  *
  * A database may only be opened by one process at a time; this is enforced
  * by LevelDB by using a file lock. Within a process, operations on a value
  * of type [db] (such as {!get}, {!put}, {!iterator}, {!Iterator.make} or
  * {!Snapshot.make}) can be performed concurrently in different threads.
  * Values of type [iterator], [writebatch], [snapshot] and [read_access] must
  * not be used simultaneously from two different threads, so external
  * synchronization (e.g. using [Mutex]) is required.
  *
  * As an exception to the above rule, it is possible to close a [db] with
  * [iterator], [snapshot] or [read_access] values in use. Values of these
  * types can also be released/closed in a thread while they are being used in
  * another. In both cases, the thread that is releasing/closing the value
  * will wait until the current operation is finished and invalidate the value
  * so that any further operations on it will fail.
  *)
