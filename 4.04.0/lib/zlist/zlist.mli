(** Lazily-realized lists.

    A lazy structure allows arbitrary transformations to be executed without
    forcing each intermediate representation in memory. When the final result is
    desired, it can be transformed into a strict structure.

    One interesting property of lazy lists is that infinite structures can be
    constructed without being evaluated.

    This implementation is heavily inspired by "Functional Programming in
    Scala", by Chiusano and Bjarnason (2014).

    {1 Some examples}

    Each of these examples assumes that
    {[
      open Zlist
      open Lazy_list
    ]}
    has been executed.

    - Generate an infinite sequence of even numbers and sample 10 of them:
    {[
      let evens = enum_from 0 |> map (fun x -> 2 * x) in
      evens |> take 4 ;;
    ]}
    {[
      - : int list = [0; 2; 4; 6]
    ]}

    - Compute an infinite list of Fibonacci numbers and sample 8 of them:
    {[
      let fibs = iterate (0, 1) (fun (a, b) -> b, a + b) |> map snd in
      fibs |> take 8 |> to_list ;;
    ]}
    {[
      - : int list = [1; 1; 2; 3; 5; 8; 13; 21]
    ]}

    - A quicksort-like algorithm:
    {[
      let ( !! ) = Lazy.force ;;
      let ( ++ ) = concat ;;
    ]}
    {[
      let rec sort = function
        | Nil -> Nil
        | Cons (p, lxs) -> begin
            let smaller = filter ((<) p) !!lxs in
            let greater = filter ((>=) p) !!lxs in
            sort smaller ++ unit p ++ sort greater
          end
      in
      sort (of_list [10; 2; 8; 5; 1; 0; 20; 3]) |> to_list ;;
    ]}
    {[
      - : int list = [20; 10; 8; 5; 3; 2; 1; 0]
    ]} *)

  (** {1 Representation} *)

  type 'a t =
    | Nil
    | Cons of 'a Lazy.t * 'a t Lazy.t



  (** {1 Construction} *)

  val of_list :
    'a list -> 'a t

  val of_array :
    'a array -> 'a t

  val unit :
    'a -> 'a t
  (** [unit a] constructs a lazy list consisting only of the item [a]. *)



  (** {1 Generation}

      These functions are used to generate lazy lists from specifications. *)

  val fill :
    int -> 'a -> 'a t
  (** [fill n a] generates a lazy list consisting of [n] instances of the item
      [a]. *)

  val unfold :
    's -> ('s -> ('s * 'b) option) -> 'b t
  (** State-based generation.

      Starting with an initial state, generate a new state and a value.
      Termination is indicated by an outcome of [None]. *)

  val iterate :
    'a -> ('a -> 'a) -> 'a t
  (** Generate an infinite lazy list by repeatedly iterating on a value. *)

  val continually :
    'a -> 'a t
  (** [continually a] generates an infinite lazy list consisting of the item
      [a]. *)

  val enum_from :
    int -> int t
  (** [enum_from z] generates an infinite lazy list consisting of the integers
      beginning at [z] and incremented by one at each step. *)

  val enum_from_to :
    int -> int -> int t
  (** Like {! enum_from}, but the result is a finite lazy list that terminates at
      the upper bound. *)

  val cycle :
    'a t -> 'a t
  (** Generate an infinite lazy list consisting of cycles of the argument. *)



  (** {1 Manipulation} *)

  val head :
    'a t -> 'a option
  (** The first item in a lazy list, or [None] if the list is empty. *)

  val tail :
    'a t -> 'a t
  (** Everything but the first item in a lazy list. This is the dual of {!
      head}.

      In the case of an empty lazy list, the result is {! Nil}. *)

  val take :
    int -> 'a t -> 'a t
  (** [take n t] is a lazy list consisting of the first [n] items in [t]. *)

  val take_while :
    ('a -> bool) -> 'a t -> 'a t
  (** [take_while f t] is a lazy list consisting of the first items of [t] that
      satisfy the predicate [f]. The first item in [t] that does not satisfy the
      predicate terminates the sequence. *)

  val drop :
    int -> 'a t -> 'a t
  (** [drop n t] is the lazy list [t] without its first [n] items. *)

  val drop_while :
    ('a -> bool) -> 'a t -> 'a t
  (** [drop_while f t] is the lazy list [t] without the first items that satisfy
      the predicate [f]. The first item in [t] that does not satisfy the predicate
      terminates the sequence. *)

  val map :
    ('a -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b t
  (** [map f t] is the lazy list [t] with the [f] applied to each of its items. *)

  val flat_map :
    ('a -> 'b t) -> 'a t -> 'b t
  (** [flat_map f t] is equivalent to [map f t |> flatten]. *)

  val filter :
    ('a -> bool) -> 'a t -> 'a t
  (** [filter f t] is the lazy list [t] with only the items that satisfy the
      predicate [f]. *)

  val map_filter :
    ('a -> 'b option) -> 'a t -> 'b t
  (** [map_filter f t] applies [f] to each element in [t] and produces a new lazy
      list consisting of the non-[None] values. *)

  val flatten :
    'a t t -> 'a t
  (** Flatten a lazy list of lazy lists. *)



  (** {1 Querying} *)

  val exists :
    ('a -> bool) -> 'a t -> bool
  (** Check for the existence of an item in the lazy list that satisfies a
      predicate.

      The first item to satisfy the predicate terminates the realization of the
      list. *)

  val for_all :
    ('a -> bool) -> 'a t -> bool
  (** Check that all items in the lazy list satisfy the predicate.

      This requires realizing the entirety of the structure. *)

  val find :
    ('a -> bool) -> 'a t -> 'a option
  (** Return the first item in the lazy list that satisfies the predicate. *)



  (** {1 Combining} *)

  val concat :
    'a t -> 'a t -> 'a t
  (** Combine two lazy lists into a single lazy list, one after the other. *)

  val zip_with :
    ('a -> 'b -> 'c) -> 'a t -> 'b t -> 'c t
  (** Merge two lazy lists together with a generating function. *)

  val zip :
    'a t -> 'b t -> ('a * 'b) t
  (** Merge two lazy lists into a lazy list of pairs. *)

  val zip_all_with :
    ('a option -> 'b option -> 'c) -> 'a t -> 'b t -> 'c t
  (** Like {! zip_with}, but merge elements from differently sized lazy
      lists. *)

  val zip_all :
    'a t -> 'b t -> ('a option * 'b option) t
  (** Like {! zip}, but merge elements from differently sized lazy lists. *)

  (** {1 Folding} *)

  val to_list :
    'a t -> 'a list
  (** Realize a lazy list into a strict list. *)

  val fold_right :
    'b Lazy.t -> ('a -> 'b Lazy.t -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b
  (** Fold over a lazy list from the right with an accumulation function.

      Since the folding function is lazy in the second argument, evaluation of the
      lazy list can be short-circuited. *)

  val fold_left :
    'b -> ('b -> 'a -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b
  (** Fold over a lazy list from the left with an accumulation function. *)



  (** {1 Iterating} *)

  val iter :
    ('a -> unit) -> 'a t -> unit
    (** [iter f t] applies the function [f] to each item in the lazy list. This only
        makes sense when [f] performs stateful effects. *)
