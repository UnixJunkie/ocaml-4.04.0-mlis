(** 
    A simplified AST to represent a TAP document 

    This module is used to create document trees whose output 
    conforms to the TAP protocol. Not many user-servicable 
    parts in here, so unless you are curious, you are more 
    likely to find what you are looking for in the [TestSimple]
    or [TestBuilder] docs.
    
*)

(** All tests have a status, which represents the passing or 
    failing of that particular test. *)
type status = Ok | NotOk

(** 
Tests can have directives associated with them, right now we 
only support the TODO directive. Support for SKIP may come in
future versions.
*)
type directive  = Todo of string

(** 
Diagnostics are bits of text which can be associated with 
either a test case itself, or within it's own diagnostic node.
*)
type diagnostic = Diag of string list

(** 
These are the possible nodes of the document, they are pretty 
much self explanitory I think.
*)
type node = TestCaseNode     of status * int * string * diagnostic option
          | TodoTestCaseNode of status * int * string * directive * diagnostic option
          | DiagnosticNode   of diagnostic
          | PlanNode         of int

(** The document is simply a list of nodes *)
type t = Document of node list

(** {2 Utilities} *)

(** Functions for counting the node types. *)

val count_test_nodes : node list -> int -> int 
val count_tests : t -> int
val count_test_failures : t -> int

(** Functions for creating standard footers. 
    These are called by [init_document] *)

val create_failure_footer : int -> int -> node
val create_count_footer   : int -> int -> node

(** {2 Document initializer} *)

(** After constructing a document, you must initialize it
    to assure that it has all the correct footers. *)
val init_document : t -> t 

(** {2 String converters} *)

(** These are string conversion functions for each of the 
    types defined in this module. *)
