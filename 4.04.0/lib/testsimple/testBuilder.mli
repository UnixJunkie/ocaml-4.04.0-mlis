(** 
    A module for building test functions
    
    If you want to build customized testing functions which 
    can easily comingle with TestSimple's testing functions
    you need to use this module to build those functions with. 
    
    The best documentation for this is probably the source 
    code for TestSimple itself. 
*)

(** This initalizes the test plan. *)
val create_test_plan : ?count:int -> unit -> unit

(** This builds a simple tests case. *)
val build_test_case : ?todo:string -> ?diag:TAPDocument.diagnostic -> bool -> string -> unit

(** Utility function to handle building diagnostic nodes *)
val build_diagnostic : string -> unit

(** This builds an extended diagnostic message, 
    showing the values gotten and the 
    values that were expected. *)
val build_extended_diagnostic_message : bool -> 'a -> 'a -> string -> TAPDocument.diagnostic option
(** This function uses ExtLib.dump to display
    the got and expected values. *)

(** this builds a simpler diagnostic message *)
val build_diagnostic_message : bool -> string -> TAPDocument.diagnostic option

(** {2 Testing the Test framework} *)

(** 
    This module can be used to test the ouput of tests 
    which are built with TestBuilder. This module is 
    actually used in the TestSimple test suite to test
    itself.

module Tester :
sig
    (** This replaces [TestSimple.plan] but returns 
        a string rather then printing to stdout *)
    val plan : int -> (unit -> unit) -> string

    (** This replaces [TestSimple.no_plan] but returns 
        a string rather then printing to stdout *)
    val no_plan : (unit -> unit) -> string
